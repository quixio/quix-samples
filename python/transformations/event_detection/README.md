# Event Detection

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/Event-Detection) demonstrates how to consume data from a Kafka topic, filter the data based on some criteria and publish the result to an output topic.

It shows how to make real-time decisions on your data by looking at the `Brake` value and if a condition is met will output JSON message to the output topic.

You can adapt this code to suit your needs.
