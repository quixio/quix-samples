# Starter transformation

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/starter_transformation) demonstrates how to consume and transform data from a Kafka topic
and publish these results to another Kafka topic, all using our `StreamingDataFrame`.

This boilerplate will run in Quix Cloud but largely has placeholder operations, so you 
will need to add your own to do something besides printing the data to console!

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: Name of the input topic to listen to.
- **output**: Name of the output topic to write to.

## Possible `StreamingDataFrame` Operations

Many different operations and transformations are available, so 
be sure to [explore what's possible](https://quix.io/docs/quix-streams/processing.html)!
