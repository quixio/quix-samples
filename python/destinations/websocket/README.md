# Websocket Destination

This connector demonstrates how to consume data from a Kafka topic using Quix Streams and send it to connected WebSocket clients.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the `Connectors` tab to use this connector.

Clicking `Set up connector` allows you to enter your connection details and runtime parameters.

Then either: 
* click `Test connection & deploy` to deploy the pre-built and configured container into Quix. 

* or click `Customise connector` to inspect or alter the code before deployment.

## Environment Variables

The connector uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the input topic (Default: `input`, Required: `True`)
- **WS_USERNAME**: Username for WebSocket authentication (Required: `True`)
- **WS_PASSWORD**: Password for WebSocket authentication (Required: `True`)


## Configuration

If deploying to Quix Cloud you will need to create secrets for the username and password.
See the [docs](https://quix.io/docs/deploy/secrets-management.html) for more information on how to do this.

## Connecting

To connect to the websocket server from your client use the url, ip address or server name for the websocket server (including the port) and the message key from the incomming topic.

For example, if your ip address is `127.0.0.1`, your port is `80` and your message key is `DATA001` your connection url would be:

`ws://127.0.0.1:80/DATA001` Connecting to this websocket URL will allow you to receive data for the `DATA001` message key only.

Alternatively to subscribe to data from all message keys use `*`:

`ws://127.0.0.1:80/*` Connecting to this websocket URL will allow you to receive data for all message keys.

NOTE: if deploying on a secure port use `wss://` in place os `ws://` (Quix Cloud uses secure connections)


## Requirements / Prerequisites

You will need to have a Quix account and a Kafka topic to consume data from. 

## How it works

The application sets up a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections. Clients can connect to the WebSocket server and authenticate using basic authentication. Once authenticated, clients can receive messages from the Kafka topic.

The server checks if the key of the incoming message matches any of the connected clients' paths or if any client is connected with a wildcard `*`. If a match is found, the message is sent to the respective clients.
