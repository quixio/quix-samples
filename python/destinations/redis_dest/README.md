# Redis Destination

[This connector](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/destinations/redis_dest) demonstrates how to consume data from a Kafka topic and persist the data to a Redis database using the Redis Python client.

This sample will write JSON data to Redis.
We assume that the incoming data will have a `key` field, this will be combined with the `redis_key_prefix` environment variable to create the Redis key where data will be stored.

Note that you need [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/about/about-stack/) to use this code sample.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.cloud.quix.io/signup?utm_campaign=github) account or log-in and visit the `Connectors` tab to use this connector.

Clicking `Set up connector` allows you to enter your connection details and runtime parameters.

Then either: 
* click `Test connection & deploy` to deploy the pre-built and configured container into Quix. 

* or click `Customise connector` to inspect or alter the code before deployment.

## Environment Variables

The connector uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the input topic (Default: `input`, Required: `True`)
- **redis_host**: Host address for the Redis instance (Required: `True`)
- **redis_port**: Port for the Redis instance (Default: `6379`, Required: `True`)
- **redis_password**: Password for the Redis instance (Default: `None`, Required: `False`)
- **redis_username**: Username for the Redis instance (Default: `None`, Required: `False`)
- **redis_key_prefix**: The prefix for the key to store data under.

## Requirements / Prerequisites

You will need to have a Redis Stack database. Either you can use the [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/cloud/overview/) or
you can install Redis locally. You can find the instructions to [install Redis locally](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-stack/).
