# BigQuery

[This connector](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/destinations/big_query) is used to stream data from Quix to a BigQuery data warehouse. It handles both parameter and event data.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.cloud.quix.io/signup?utm_campaign=github) account or log-in and visit the `Connectors` tab to use this connector.

Clicking `Set up connector` allows you to enter your connection details and runtime parameters.

Then either: 
* click `Test connection & deploy` to deploy the pre-built and configured container into Quix. 

* or click `Customise connector` to inspect or alter the code before deployment.

## Environment variables

The connector uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: Name of the input topic to read from.
- **PROJECT_ID**: The BigQuery GCP Project ID.
- **DATASET_ID**: The target Bigquery dataset ID.
- **DATASET_LOCATION**: Location of BigQuery dataset.
- **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON**: The service account json string for the BigQuery GCP project. [Tutorial on how to create service account.](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-console)
- **MAX_QUEUE_SIZE**: Max queue size for the sink ingestion.

## Known limitations 
- BigQuery fails to immediately recognize new Schema changes such as adding a new field when streaming insert data.
- BigQuery doesn't allow deleting data when streaming insert data.
