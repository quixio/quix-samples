# MQTT

[This connector](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/destinations/MQTT) demonstrates how to produce data from a Kafka topic and publish it to an MQTT broker.

The MQTT topic the example produces to will be `mqtt_topic_root`/`message_key`.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.cloud.quix.io/signup?utm_campaign=github) account or log-in and visit the `Connectors` tab to use this connector.

Clicking `Set up connector` allows you to enter your connection details and runtime parameters.

Then either: 
* click `Test connection & deploy` to deploy the pre-built and configured container into Quix. 

* or click `Customise connector` to inspect or alter the code before deployment.

## Requirements / Prerequisites

You'll need to have an MQTT broker either locally or in the cloud

## Environment Variables

- **input**: Name of the input topic to listen to.
- **mqtt_topic_root**: The root for messages in MQTT, this can be anything.
- **mqtt_server**: The address of your MQTT server.
