# JupyterLab

This sample demonstrates how to deploy a JupyterLab instance so you can run
Jupyter notebooks from the platform.

## How to Run

1. Log in or sign up at [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) and navigate to the Code Samples section.
2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Fill in the required environment variables for your JupyterLab instance.
4. Enable state, otherwise changes will be lost on restart. Please note, the necessary storage type may not be supported on all Quix Platforms.

For more configuration options and details, refer to [Mongo Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).
