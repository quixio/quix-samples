# Twitter stream example

A Quix model can be used to bridge data from almost any source. In this case, we'll use a Twitter developer account to stream Tweet data with a view to running real time ML models on the feed later on.

## Requirements/prerequisites

 - A Twitter developer account (sign up at [https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access))

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **output**: This is the output topic for Twitter data.
- **twitter_bearer_token**: Your Twitter bearer token.

## Docs
Check out the [SDK docs](https://quix.ai/docs/sdk/introduction.html) for detailed usage guidance.

## How to run
Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=github) account to edit or deploy this application without a local environment setup.

Alternativelly, you can learn how to set up your local environment [here](/python/local-development).
