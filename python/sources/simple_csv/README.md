# Demo CSV Data

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/simple_csv) demonstrates how to read data from a simple, three-column CSV file and publish that data to a Kafka topic.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Deploy` on the Sample, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **Topic**: Name of the output topic to write into.

## Your data

To publish your own data, replace the CSV data with your own.

After saving the sample to your workspace, you can copy and paste your data into the CSV file or upload your own CSV file and change the python code to look for your CSV file name instead of `demo-data.csv`.
