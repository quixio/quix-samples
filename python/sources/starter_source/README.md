# Starter data source

[This code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/starter_source) demonstrates how to use the Quix Streams Source framework to publish 
hard-coded lines of JSON data to a Kafka topic.

This boilerplate runs in Quix Cloud without any necessary alterations.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Deploy` on the Sample, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **output**: Name of the output topic to write into.

## Using Premade Sources

Quix Streams has numerous prebuilt sources available to use out of the box, so be
