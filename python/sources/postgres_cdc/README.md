# PostgreSQL CDC

[This connector](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/postgres_cdc) demonstrates how to capture changes to a PostgreSQL database table (using CDC) and publish the change events to a Kafka topic.

## How to run

Clicking `Set up connector` allows you to enter your connection details and runtime parameters.

Then either: 
* click `Test connection & deploy` to deploy the pre-built and configured container into Quix.
