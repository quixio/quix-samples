# Prometheus

This sample demonstrates how to deploy and use Prometheus for monitoring in your environment. This configuration uses the official Prometheus Docker image and a custom configuration file. Please note: this image is provided by Prometheus and is offered as-is, with no specific support from Quix.

## How to Run

1. Log in or sign up at [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) and navigate to the Code Samples section.
2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Ensure container state is enabled; otherwise, any metrics or configuration may be lost on restart.
4. Adjust dockerfile for your retention needs or apply additional config in prometheus.yml.
