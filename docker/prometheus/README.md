# Prometheus

This sample demonstrates how to deploy and use Prometheus for monitoring in your environment. This configuration uses the official Prometheus Docker image and a custom configuration file. Please note: this image is provided by Prometheus and is offered as-is, with no specific support from Quix.

## How to Run

1. Log in or sign up at [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) and navigate to the Code Samples section.
2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Enable state, otherwise any metrics or configuration may be lost on restart. Please note, the necessary storage type may not be supported on all Quix Platforms.
4. Adjust dockerfile for your retention needs or apply additional config in prometheus.yml.
