## Using with a Quix Cloud Amazon S3 Connectors

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "<MINIO ROOT USERNAME>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "<MINIO ROOT PASSWORD>"

```

2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Fill in the required environment variables for your MinIO instance.
4. Enable state, otherwise changes will be lost on restart. Please note, the necessary storage type may not be supported on all Quix Platforms.
