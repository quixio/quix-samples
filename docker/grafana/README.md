# Grafana

This sample demonstrates how to deploy and use Grafana as a visualization tool in your Quix Cloud pipeline. Please note: this image is provided by Grafana and is offered as-is, with no specific support from Quix.

## How to Run

1. Log in or sign up at [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) and navigate to the Code Samples section.
2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Fill in the required environment variables for your Grafana instance.

After deploying, update your pipeline YAML to add the necessary network configuration:

- Click the **YAML** button in the pipeline view.
- Select **Edit code** near the top right.
- Locate the `deployments` section.
- Find the `grafana` deployment.
- Under `resources`, add:

  ```yaml
  network:
    serviceName: grafana
    ports:
      - port: 3000
        targetPort: 3000
  ```
A complete deployment entry should resemble:

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: grafana
    application: grafana
    version: latest
    deploymentType: Service
    resources:
      cpu: 1000
      memory: 8000
      replicas: 1
    network:
      serviceName: grafana
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          targetPort: 3000

```

Once youâ€™ve updated the YAML, click the blue Sync environment button and then select Sync to this commit on the popup. Your updated configuration will be applied, and the Grafana service will restart.

## Save dashboards with code

Dashboards can be [exported](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/share-dashboards-panels/#export-a-dashboard-as-json) and saved under the `provisioning` folder, see `sensors.json` for example. This allows you to programmatically set up dashboards and protected them from accidental modification or if you want to set them up in other environments.
