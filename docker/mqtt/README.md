# MQTT (Mosquitto)

This sample demonstrates how to deploy and use Mosquitto's MQTT server in your pipeline. Please note: this image is provided by Mosquitto and is offered as-is, with no specific support from Quix.

## Using with a Quix Cloud MQTT Connector

This deployment will work seamlessly with the [Quix Cloud MQTT sink connector](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/destinations/mqtt).

Simply provide the following arguments to the connector, 
where `username` and `password` are the credentials used when 
creating this service: 

```shell
MQTT_USERNAME="<YOUR USERNAME>"  # (default: "admin")
MQTT_PASSWORD="<YOUR PASSWORD>"
MQTT_HOST="mqtt"
MQTT_PORT="1883"
```

## How to Run

1. Log in or sign up at [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.io/signup?xlink=github) and navigate to the Code Samples section.
2. Click **Deploy** to launch a pre-built container.
3. Fill in the required environment variables for your MongoDB instance.
4. Enable state, otherwise changes will be lost on restart. Please note, the necessary storage type may not be supported on all Quix Platforms.

For more configuration options and details, refer to [Mosquitto Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto).
